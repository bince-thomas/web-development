                                <strong>Isaac Newton</strong> was an English physicist and mathematician, who made seminal contributions to several
                            domains of science, and was considered a leading scientist of his era and one of the most influential
                            scientists of all time. He was born prematurely on 25 December 1642 in Lincolnshire, England, of Hannah
                            Ayscough and Isaac Newton (father) [1]. His father passed away before he was born. His mother
                            remarried when he was 3 years old and he was left in the care of his grandmother, a situation he resented.
                            He attended the Kingâ€™s School in Grantham where he learned Latin among other things until the age of
                            17. In 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and was educated in Aristotelian philosophy.
                            However, Newton also read the works of Descartes, Galileo, and Kepler. In 1665/1666 he spent most of
                            the time at his ancestral place in Lincolnshire because of the dangerous spread of plague in Cambridge.
